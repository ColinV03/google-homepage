This is a document of the initial project of building a webpage that is to be a copy of a current functioning page. The page that I will choose to copy initially is the Google.com address. Upon completion, the skills I will have used will be primarily HTML and CSS to stylize the page. Upon completion, I should be confident using stylesheets, hover commands, hyperlinks, and be able to have a solid, working understanding of HTML and CSS.
